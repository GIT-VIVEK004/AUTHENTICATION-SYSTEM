# AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
This authentication system is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It includes user registration, login, and secure access control with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security. The front-end React app communicates with the Node.js/Express backend, which handles API requests and interacts with MongoDB for data storage. The system ensures protected routes for authenticated users, providing a complete and secure user authentication flow.
